Comeon Tennis Betting
=========

Comeon is a automated tennis betting tool. In general, it is getting
data from different provider (tennisexplorer, pinnacle, tennisabstract) 
and calcualte good picks for betting on.

The project works find with pinnalce and tennisabsract. Other provider 
(matchbook, Betdaq) are planed, but not finish at the time. There is also
a betbtc implementation for betting with Bitcoin, but the market is not 
very liquide.

A surebet job (pinnacle, betbtc) also exist, but no longer work (BETBTC 
do not accpet this bets anymore, no idea why).

I will publish it under GNU, if someone want to use it.
